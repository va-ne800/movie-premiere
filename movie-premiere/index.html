        <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x450" alt="Movie Poster">
        <p>    The Sun to the Moonlight tells the story of Amara Kade, a woman who shines brightly in public but quietly struggles in private. Known for her fearless journalism, she exposes corruption without hesitation. People admire her strength, but no one sees the weight she carries when the cameras turn off. She has learned how to survive alone, convincing herself that needing someone is a weakness.

Then she meets Elias Moon — calm, observant, and emotionally guarded. He studies the moon for a living, yet he understands darkness in a way few people do. He notices the cracks in Amara’s confidence long before she admits there there.

As Amara investigates a powerful businessman tied to a dangerous conspiracy, she unknowingly puts herself in harm’s way. Elias, still healing from a past loss he blames himself for, must decide whether to protect his heart or risk loving someone who burns as brightly as the sun. Together, they discover that light and darkness aren't opposites — they are incomplete without each other.   </p>
